# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      In an article https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#GDP%20per%20capita%20and%20health%20consumption%20spending%20per%20capita,%202022%20(U.S.%20dollars,%20PPP%20adjusted), comparing the GDP per capita & Health Spending, a scatterplot with a trendline was presented (). 
      
      Good Data Visualization for the following reasons:
        o	Chart Title - an accurate reflection of the chart info
        o	Simplicity & relevance ‚Äì info presented is focused and relevant to the title/purpose of the article
        o	Clarity ‚Äì graph presented is very clear, no clutter despite more than 30 countries‚Äô info presented
        o	Interpretability ‚Äì intuitive & extremely easy to interpret and understand by a quick visual scan: 
        	    U.S has the highest health spending despite not being the wealthiest
        	    The trendline indicates health spending increases with GDP per capita
        	    Both the range of health spending ($1.2K - $8.0K) & GDP per capita (24K ‚Äì 146K) is very wide
        o	Interactivity ‚Äì by hovering the cursor to each of the circles, one can tell what the country is & the corresponding health spending & GDP info
        o	Color ‚Äì by having a green circle which is different than the rest of the countries, the health spending of the U.S stands out
        o	Storytelling ‚Äì the U.S is an outlier when it comes to health spending among >30 countries, despite it's not the wealthiest country by GDP/capita
        o	Informative ‚Äì data for >30 countries are presented for comparison 
        o	Source ‚Äì credible source from OECD, transparency of expenses excluded e.g. investments in structure, equipment & research. 
      
      Area of improvement:
        o	For the title of the chart, ‚Äúppp adjusted‚Äù could be substantiated as a note or hyperlinked to a definition
        o	As health expenditure is understandably linked to GDP per capita, I would have the health expenditure as % of GDP per capita included in each circle when hovered
        o	I would add/change color of the circles based on health spending as % of GDP per capita e.g. light blue if the ratio is below median, orange if it is around the median, and pink if higher than the median, and keep a bright red circle for the U.S to make it stand out

    Bad Data Visualization for the following reasons:

        The Overall Title of the Data Visualization is "Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program in America (2022-2014)".
        Beneath the Title is the rationale of why the data is needed i.e. To reduce Medicare payment for hospitals with excess readmission. And then define what excess readmission is for 3 diseases, including heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia. 
        Blunder ‚Äì 5 disease categories but excess readmission for only 3 defined. 2 got missed i.e. COPD & HIP-KNEE
        
        At a glance, it looks very pleasant with good colors. Delving deeper into the info presented, it is not as appealing.

        Three sections of Data Visualization:

        1. 
        
        Clarity - The Upper Left shows a US map with excess or normal readmission rate by state. Shockingly, all except Nevada in Western & Central US has ‚Äònormal‚Äô  readmission rate and most states Eastern U.S have excess readmission rate. This is anomalous. Data Quality/processing & credibility calls into question. It is not clear how the state-wide excess readmission rate is calculated e.g. weighted mean, or an unweighted average of 5 disease categories.
        
        Relevance - On the Upper Right, there are 2 sets of bar charts: the left represents the number of discharges by disease category; on the right is the corresponding number of readmissions. It is unclear how many of the readmissions are excess and how many are normal. Therefore, it would have been more relevant to show the excess readmission rate rather than just the readmission rates. By showing the excess readmission rate, it would show the magnitude of the problem and hence the need for readmission reduction. 
        
        Scale - Whilst the bars on the discharge side are drawn to scale, the readmission bars are not comparing to the discharge side e.g. the length of the discharge bars is the same as that of the readmission for Heart Failure & COPD, despite they are 4-fold different. This is highly misleading from a visual perspective.
        
        2. 
        
        Color - For the scatterplot & regression line, the # of Discharge is plotted against # of Readmission. 3 colors are used to depict whether they are normal or excess readmissions. Whilst the very light circles depict normal and the darker brown depicts excess readmission, when I hover the pointer to the individual circles, the medium color could depict normal or excess discharges. This is very misleading. It could definitely be fixed by using 2 colors only ‚Äì one for normal & one for excess. 
        
        When hovering to the regression line, the regression equation shows. The equation does not add value to the visual.

        3. 
        
        Data Overload - The Bottom section shows an interactive Detailed Report, with individual hospitals shown in each of the states with detailed info re. # of Discharges, # of Readmissions, Predicted Readmissions rate, Expected Readmission rate, Excess Readmission Ratio. I expect the dataset to be linked rather than having tons of info presented as part of data visualization.
        
        Data Source - from Data.World, a private company. Not sure if the data quality is verifiable, as I went to the website & could not retrieve the data.
        
        
        Room for Improvement:
        1. Ensure definition of Excess Readmission for all 5 disease categories are properly stated instead of just 3
        
        2. Ensure the calculation for state-wide Excessive Readmission rate is clearly stated especially in the face of anomalous distribution of Excess Readmission rates i.e. almost exclusively Normal rate in western U.S & Excess rate in Eastern U.S. I expect a mixture of normal & excessive readmission throughout the U.S.
        
        3. Bar charts of # of Discharge on the left vs. # of Excess Readmission on the right, instead of Total Readmission on the right, as Total Readmission is not necessarily relevant to the Excess Readmission reduction program. 
        
        4. Length of the bars needs to be drawn to scale

        5. For the scatterplot, the color of circles can be limited to 2 (instead of 3) which would show normal & excessive readmission without ambiguity.
        
        6. Plotting # of Excess Readmission vs. # of Discharge is an alternative way of presenting the data which is probaly better & more relevant to the title. Additionally, plotting the above by disease category may be more informative and to focus on where to improve. 

    Overall, the Data Visualization does not tell the story re. the Hospital Readmission Reduction program itself. To substantiate, I expect the # of Excess Readmissions and the associated cost reduction to be clearly & reasonably demonstrated without a high cognitive load.
